Citi Bikers Ride Analysis.

The analysis presents a comparative exploration between winter and summer months concerning Citi Bikers' ride patterns. Focused on the year 2021, particular attention was given to January, representing winter, and July, symbolizing summer. These months were chosen due to their substantial influx of people into the cityâ€”January for the New Year holiday and July for the typical summer surge. The aim was to discern any disparities in biking behaviours influenced by seasonal variations.
The findings, derived through Tableau, revealed intriguing insights:
1)	Winter Ridership improving equal to Summer: The data showcased a higher volume of riders during the summer months compared to the winter season. However, some station performing better during winter compared to summer. While the available data didn't explicitly elucidate the reason behind this trend, one plausible assumption is that in winter, city riders might utilize bikes for both commuting and fitness purposes. Conversely, during summer, biking seems primarily utilitarian, serving as a mode of transportation.
In understanding this trend, further investigation could explore how weather and seasonal changes impact people's preferences in using bikes within the cityscape. Additionally, collecting more nuanced data might provide deeper insights into the riders' motivations during these contrasting periods.

2)	Consistent Peak Hours Across Seasons:

An intriguing similarity emerged in the peak hours observed during both winter and summer months. The period from 1 pm to 6 pm consistently marked the peak riding hours, showing a parallel trend across these distinct seasons. This pattern suggests a commonality in rider behaviour irrespective of weather variations.
The trend may be indicative of a predominant local rider demographic, including working-class individuals, making use of bikes as a preferred mode of transportation during their work hours. This inclination to bike around the city during these hours could be attributed to the desire to circumvent traffic congestion and navigate the urban landscape more efficiently.
Further exploration into the specific demographics and motivations behind the consistent peak hours could involve conducting surveys or interviews with riders during these times. Understanding their preferences, such as the appeal of biking for convenience or health benefits, could provide valuable insights into urban commuting habits, aiding in infrastructure planning and tailored service offerings.

3)	Insights into Ride Station Locations and User Demographics:

The analysis uncovered interesting trends regarding ride station placement, user demographics, and subscription patterns. Notably, ride stations predominantly exist within high-income areas, indicating a potential correlation between affluent neighbourhoods and bike usage. Additionally, a significant portion of riders falls within the age bracket of 35 to 45 years, suggesting a particular affinity for bike rides among this demographic. Surprisingly, non-subscribers outnumber subscribers, hinting at a reluctance towards commitment for longer-term memberships.
The data hints at a paradigm shift in transportation preferences, indicating that the high-income group might prefer biking over driving, potentially due to factors such as environmental consciousness or urban convenience. Moreover, the openness of the 35 to 45 age group towards ridesharing signifies a promising avenue for expanding bike-sharing concepts.
To encourage more subscriptions, strategies to highlight the benefits of membership, such as cost-effectiveness and convenience, could be implemented. Introducing enhanced bike models with advanced safety features might attract a broader spectrum of users, especially those hesitant about committing to a subscription. Furthermore, tailored marketing campaigns and incentives could be devised to entice diverse groups to explore the advantages of ride-sharing memberships.
Exploring options like offering trial memberships or flexible subscription plans might appeal to users wary of long-term commitments. Collaborations with local businesses or city initiatives to promote biking culture and emphasize the collective benefits of ridesharing could also foster a more inclusive and engaged rider community.
